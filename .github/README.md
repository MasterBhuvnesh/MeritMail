<h2 align="center">Welcome to GDG MeritMail</h2>

Hey everyone, I’m **Bhuvnesh**, creator of **MeritMail**. Glad you're here!

**MeritMail** is a simple, powerful desktop application designed to streamline the process of generating and mailing certificates. Built with Electron, it brings this functionality right to your desktop in a user-friendly package.

What started as a utility to handle certificates for community events has grown into a more robust project for everyone. Whether you're managing a workshop, a study jam, or any event, MeritMail aims to make recognizing participants easy.

**Key Features**

- **Bulk generation** - Create hundreds of personalized certificates from a single template and a CSV/JSON data source.
- **Direct mailing** - Send certificates straight to recipients from within the app (SMTP configuration supported).
- **Simple interface** - Clean, step-by-step workflow with preview and quick edits.
- **Cross-platform** - Built with Electron to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Happy learning, and see you around.
